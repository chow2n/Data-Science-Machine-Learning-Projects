## Projects

### [Predicting Weather in Australia Model](https://github.com/chow2n/PredictingWeatherAUS "PredictingWeatherAUS")
- Cleaned, preprocessed, and normalized data with tools from the Scikit-Learn and Pandas libraries
- Optimized Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models using GridSearch to determine the most
appropriate parameters for each model
- Created classification reports and visualizations with Matplotlib library to evaluate and compare the accuracy of each model

### [Airline Satisfaction Classification in PySpark](https://github.com/chow2n/AirlineSatisfaction-PySparkClassification "AirlineSatisfactionPySpark")
- Utilized PySpark libraries to preprocess and transform data and created correlation tables to measure strength of features relative to dependent variable
- Used Chi-Square Selector to extract most optimized features for predicting the model
- Applied GridSearch on Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models to hypertune parameters to retrieve highest accuracy model
